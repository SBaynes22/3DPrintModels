 3D Printable Designs Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of original 3D printable designs. This repository showcases a range of practical components Iâ€™ve designed for PCB enclosures, models from my favourite games, and other practical models. All models were created using Blender and are optimized for PLA 3D printing.

This repository aims to demonstrates my skills in:

- Mechanical design for functional parts
- Design for Manufacture Principles (DFM) with 3D printing in mind
- Iterative prototyping and problem solving
- Tolerance design and precision modelling
