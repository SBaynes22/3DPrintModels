 3D Printable Designs Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of original 3D printable designs. This repository showcases a range of practical components Iâ€™ve designed for electronics enclosures, mechanical assemblies, and prototyping tools. All models were created using Fusion 360 and are optimized for FDM and SLA 3D printing.

## ðŸ”§ About This Repository

This project demonstrates my skills in:

- **Mechanical design** for functional parts
- **Design for Manufacture (DFM)** with 3D printing in mind
- **Iterative prototyping** and problem solving
- **Parametric modeling** and tolerance design
